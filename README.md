# Tech-Blog-Application
For you tech-blog needs!

## Description
This application is made to allow you to create blog posts, comment on posts, save your posts, and more! With this application you will have to create and login to your very own account!

## How to use
In order to use this application, you must install the necessary tools using npm install. Once installed simply input node server.js and the server will start running! You will be able to see the site running at localhost 3001. This app is a work in progress and I am in the works of figuring out how to get this app on Heroku! 

## Images
